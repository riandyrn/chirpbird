# ChirpBird

This challenge has been replaced with [OwlDetect](https://github.com/riandyrn/owldetect) challenge. 😁

<!--
Welcome to Haraj take home challenge!

In this challenge you will be assigned to help fictional startup called `ChirpBird` to create their instant messaging platform. Basically they want to create platform similar like [Facebook Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/), [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), or [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).

`ChirpBird` have vision to make it easy for people around the world to stay connected. It is your job to make that happen through your system. 😁

## Requirements

You need to create system with client-server architecture. For the server you need to develop it using [Go](https://golang.org/). As for the client, you just need to create a web app (you could use whatever tools or framework to create it).

The system needs to be:

1. Capable of delivering message to client instantly through Websocket
2. Capable of delivering text message
3. Capable of hosting P2P & Group chat
4. Horizontally scalable
5. Resilient from failure (since the system will be distributed, there should be tons of potential failures)

## Deployment

It is not mandatory to deploy your system on public. However if you decided to do so, it would be very great. 

At the very least you need to deploy your system using docker-compose locally.

## Evaluation

1. System design
2. Project documentation (any docs that help people understand your project better)
    - API documentation
    - Architecture diagram
    - DB schema
    - Class diagram
    - Failure handling documentation
    - etc...
3. System fail safe strategies
4. Code readibility, cleanliness, & testability
5. UI comfortability (good UX)
6. Deployment strategy (bonus)

2. After you finish creating your changes, submit the link of your fork along with your CV & cover letter to [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/558729?so_medium=Talent&so_source=Talent).
